<h1> Hello! I'm Erica - </h1>
<div class="descrip">
    I am a San Francisco native, currently studying computer science at UCSC. <br>
    My interests and work lies in the intersection between technology, design and usability. <br>
    As a developer, I love to code, test and break things while continuously rethinking <br>
    the problem to optimize my solution. As a queer, Asian woman, I strive to design <br>
    with underreprsented communities in mind and bring my unique ideas to the table. 
    <br>
    I am passionate about ensuring that technology is accessible and inclusive of <br>
    everyone. I want to design the right thing. I want to design for <i>people</i> to <br>
    ensure that what I am building is exciting, useful and inclusive. <br>
    <br>
    Currently: Dev, Design @ Tech4Good Lab. Tutor @ UCSC. Working on personal projects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    While I love to work away at my laptop, I also love to sketch (all over my homework), <br>
    play guitar, walk dogs, and stilt walk. I am inspired by the places and people around me, <br>
    and love to meet new faces! Reach out to me at: ericamaliafong@gmail.com.
