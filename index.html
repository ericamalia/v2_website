        <div class= "bio"> Hello! I am currently a second year at UCSC studying Computer Science. I love to code and engineer 
            solutions to interesting problems. I also am very passionate about design and user experience. As a 
            developer and designer, I love to create inclusive technology that works to help under represented 
            communities! I am currently looking for summer 2019 internships in software developer or design. 
            <br><br>
            If you were wondering about my icon: I’m gay, code is fun and I love dumplings!<br>
