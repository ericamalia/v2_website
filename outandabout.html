    <div id="title"> The Problem </div>
    <div id="text">
    <br>Out and About stems from the fear and stress that LGBTQ+ 
    individuals experience when traveling, working or visiting a new place. 
    Individuals and couples often fear for their safety, well being and rights 
    in unfamiliar places. Personally, when I travel alone or with a significant other, 
    I am very aware of how I am expressing myself and affection with my significant other. 
    It's a constant feeling of caution, fear, anxiety and repression of my own self. The
    LGBTQ+ community shouldn't have to live like this. </div>

<div class="initial">
        <div id="title"> Initial Brainstorm</div>
        <div id="text">
        <br> Initially, I thought of solving this problem 
        by creating a resource that contained all the laws and rights
        that LGBTQ+ people have (and don't have) in a certain
        place. I thought that this would be a useful tool for
        LGBTQ+ people to use when traveling and to see the disparities
        in justice that exist within each country and around the world. 
        I imagined an interactive data vizualization such as a map and the ability 
        to search for a specific location. </div>

<div class="user-research">
        <div id="title"> ... but then I started to do <i> user research</i></div>
        <div id="title"> Interviews + Survey </div>
            <div id="text">
                <br>
                While my initial brainstorm was a good start, it was designed by and 
                essentially just for me. Instead, I wanted to understand how I could
                go about building a platform that caters to people's needs, is enjoyable
                and helps support a community. I wanted to understand general users' 
                background, experiences and current resources.  
                <br> <br>
                I created a set of questions that touched on four general things: 
                background, travel, technology and resources/information. In background, 
                I asked about general demographics such as age, location, current occupation or school,
                and how they identify. In travel, I asked general questions about how often they 
                traveled, reasons for travel and whom they typically travel with. I also asked some more
                product related questions such as concerns they have when visiting a new place, what 
                they are worried about may happen in new places, what precautions they take when visiting a new place
                and their general experiences when visiting somewhere new. In technology, I was interested 
                in knowing how they typically access information (mobile, web, both), what apps they
                use day to day and why, and what technology (devices, apps, websites) they typically use when
                traveling. Lastly, I asked about the resources, information and sources they typically accessed. 
                I asked about what resources people typically used to learn about LGBTQ+ issues
                and trends to understand context about people's current intake of LGBTQ+ topics and to
                understand what resources have been successful in presenting this information. I also asked about 
                where they typically stay updated on all general news/trends and how the source/writer/location 
                affects how they consume it.

                    I interviewed about five people and got eleven responses on a survey, 
                    for a total of about 16 responses. I very much enjoyed doing the in person 
                    details because I was able to collect more detailed information, give the participant
                    brief context and delve deeper into their answers with follow-up questions. However, the survey was a 
                    great way to connect with communities outside my circle of friends. I tried to interview
                    and survey those who I believed would be most likely to use the platform, such as those in 
                    the LGBTQ+ community. However, next time I would like to collect an even wider range of 
                    input by trying to reach out to people of different age groups, those not in school and 
                    people located all over the world.
